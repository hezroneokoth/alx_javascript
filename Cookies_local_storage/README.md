## Tasks

### 0. Create basic cookie

Install your development environment:

Installwebpack-dev-server by running npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev (if you have some errors of missing dependencies, install these packages: npm i -D webpack and npm i -D webpack-cli)

Create an empty file src/index.js

Run your server with node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server

In a file 0-index.html, create a basic html template:

Add two text inputs, with the id firstname and email

Add one button with the text “Log me in” that will call the function setCookies

Add one button with the text “Show the cookies” that will call the function showCookies

Create a function setCookies:

It should set the cookie firstname with the value in the firstname input

It should set the cookie email with the value in the email input

Create a function showCookies:

It should create a DOM element p

It should set the inner html with Cookies: and the value of the cookie

It should append the paragraph at the bottom of the page

Requirements:

Try to make your page to look as close to the image below as possible

![Alt text](5bcb67bddaba890742ab.png)

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/0-index.html

Use vanilla javascript to complete the task

Tips:

If you are using VSCode, you can use the plugin live server

### 1. Create cookie with expiration date and specific path

In a file 1-index.html:

Reuse the code of the previous task

Modify the way you are setting cookies to expire in 10 days

Requirements:

### 2. Read cookie

In a file 2-index.html:

Reuse the code of the previous task

Create a function getCookie:

It accepts name as argument

It should return the value of the cookie with the name passed in argument

If the cookie does not exist, it should return an empty string

add a div in html that will contain the login form:

You can reuse the one you previously wrote

It has one h2

It has two text inputs

It has one button

Write a function named showForm:

It should remove the Welcome message if it exists

It should show the form

Write a function named hideForm:

It should hide the form

Write a function named deleteCookiesAndShowForm:

It should remove the two cookies

it should show the form by calling the showForm function

Write a function named showWelcomeMessageOrForm:

if user is not logged in, the function showForm is called

If the user is logged in, replace the body of the page with a h1

It should display Welcome FIRSTNAME (logout)
(logout) should be a link

The link font should be display in normal weight, italic, and 10px to the right of the message
On click, call the function deleteCookiesAndShowForm, hide the welcome message, and show the form

Requirements:

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/3-index.html

Use vanilla javascript to complete the task

Build the Welcome message with Javascript without using HTML

The login form should look like the image below

### 4. Use js-cookie

Reusing the code from the previous task:

Add js-cookie to your html page using the jsdelivr CDN

Delete the getCookie function and use js-cookie get function instead

Use js-cookie remove function within deleteCookiesAndShowForm function

Use js-cookie set function within setCookiesAndShowWelcomeMessage function (new function that sets cookies and calls showWelcomeMessageOrForm)

Requirements:

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/4-index.html

Build the Welcome message with Javascript without using HTML

Use js-cookie for every cookie manipulation

### 5. Local storage

Let’s build a basic shopping cart in a new file. Setup your files with the following:

Create an array availableItems that will contain all the available items. Add the strings Shampoo, Soap, Sponge, and Water in the array

If Local storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one

If local storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function createStore and displayCart

Create a function addItemToCart:

It takes on argument item (string)

It adds a key to the local storage of the name of the item, and set the value to true

Create a function createStore:

Create a ul and append it to the DOM

Loop through the array of items, and create a list item to add to the ul

The item should display the name of the available product

On click the item should call the function addItemToCart

Create a function displayCart:

If the local storage does not contain any item, this function does not do anything

If the local storage contains any item, it should display the message You previously had X items in your cart in a p element that you can append to the body

Tips:

At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items

If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart

If you open a new tab, you should also see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart

Requirements:

Build the DOM using Javascript only

You must use the local storage of your browser and not a cookie or session storage

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/5-index.html

Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

### 6. Session storage

Reusing the code from the previous task, replace the use of local storage by session storage

Tips:

At this time, you should be able to see the list of available items

If you click on two of them and refresh the browser, you should see the message You previously had 2 items in your cart

If you open a new tab, you should not see any message

Requirements:

Build the DOM using Javascript only

You must use the session storage of your browser and not a cookie or local storage

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/6-index.html

Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only

### 7. Advanced use of web storage

In a new file, let’s build a more advanced cart system using Session Storage. Setup your files with the following:

Create an array availableItems that will contain all the available items. Add the strings Shampoo, Soap, Sponge, and Water to the array

If session storage is not enabled on your browser, display an alert that will contain the message Sorry, your browser does not support Web storage. Try again with a better one

If session storage is available it should allow the user to see the application and call the function createStore and displayCart

Create a function getCartFromStorage:

It should parse a string into a JSON object, returning the content of the cart stored in Session storage

If there is no cart, it should return an empty object

Create a function addItemToCart:

It accepts item(string) as argument

It adds to the cart object the item

If the same item is added multiple times, the cart store the quantity

It stores the value of the cart object in a string for the key cart in the Session Storage

It calls displayCart

Create a function removeItemfromCart:

It accepts item(string) as argument

It remove the entire item from the cart

Store the value of the cart object in a string for the key cart in the Session Storage

It calls displayCart

Create a function clearCart:

It should clear the entire Session storage

it calls displayCart

Create a function createStore:

It should add a h2 tag with the text Available products:

It should add a list with every item available for purchase

When the user click on an item, it should add it to the cart

Create a function displayCart:

It should add inside a h2 tag with the text Your cart:

It should add an empty div tag

If the div tag already exist, it should remove any list child

It calls updateCart

Create a function updateCart:

It should add a list to the div tag created previously

If the cart is empty, it should add an item Your cart is empty

If the cart is not empty, it should add the list of items within the cart with the following format: ITEM_NAME x QUANTITY (remove)

When the user clicks on remove, it should call the function removeItemfromCart

At the top of the cart, add an item named Clear my cart. When the user clicks on it, it should call the function clearCart

Tips:

You can look at the GIF below to see how the interaction with the different elements works

Requirements:

Build the DOM using Javascript only

You must use the session storage of your browser and not a cookie or local storage

Access your code with http://localhost:8080/7-index.html

Build every feature with vanilla Javascript only
src/index.js should stay empty - all your Javascript must be in your HTML, inside <script> tag
